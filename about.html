            <h2>Weightlifting</h2>
            <img src="images/lifting.jpg" alt="weightlifting">
            <p>I started weightlifting back in college and immediately got hooked on how it made me feel during and after a workout. On top of getting stronger and looking better, challenging myself to lift heavier and hitting my personal records is really fulfilling. </p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <img src="images/gaming.jpg" alt="gaming">
            <p>I remember playing games as soon as I became aware of the world. The characters, storybuilding, and the gameplay has always captivated me. I would even come up with my own games with toys I had, rules, how to win and the story behind it.</p>
            <p>As I got older, the types of games I enjoy became broader. I started getting into board games and tried various genres that I normally didn't play.</p>
